# lab-of-bioinformatics-project

## Overview

This project forms a component of the Laboratory of Bioinformatics I at the University of Bologna. The primary objective is to develop a Profile Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domain. These domains are functional regions of proteins that inhibit proteolytic enzymes, including notable examples such as aprotinin (BPTI), Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein (APP), and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). The focus of the project is to employ the HMM to identify the optimal e-value threshold for binary classification derived from HMM search outcomes.

## Project Description

### Main Objective

The principal aim is to construct a Profile HMM for the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domain, utilizing available structural data, and to use it to ascertain the optimal e-value threshold for binary classification in HMM searches.
Specific Objectives
•	Develop a model for the Kunitz domain using structural data.
•	Identify the optimal e-value threshold for binary classification based on HMM search outcomes.
